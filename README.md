# ParkinsonsProgressionModel

Requirements

Data Model Implementation (25 points)
A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model (10 points)

The data is cleaned, normalized, and standardized prior to modeling (5 points)

The model utilizes data retrieved from SQL or Spark (5 points)

The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)

Data Model Optimization (25 points)
The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself (15 points)

Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script (10 points)

GitHub Documentation (25 points)
GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use (10 points)

The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project (15 points)

Group Presentation (25 points)

### Requirements 

Task Delegation

Building of Database (SQL) + Extraction into Python via sqlalchemy (Peter)

Data Cleaning - CSV join them together, Get rid of Nulls (Kevin) 

Data Exploration (Matplot Library) (Alisha)
Are there any patients that are outliers?
Statistical significance of the mean of protein abundance overtime? 

Feature Selection for Models (Kevin)
Correlation Matrix (Which features are not correlated to disease progression?)
Covariance Matrix (Which features are correlated with each other?)
Variance Threshold (Which features don’t have any variance among each other)
For Loop to test various features against standard neural archway (128, 128, 128)

Models (Linear Regression, Ensemble Learning, Neural Network)

Hyper-optimization of Models (Keras Tuner, CLF) - 1 hr 

Results - Data Visualization
What is the Mean Square Error?
Do any models outperform the other?
Are there any outliers regarding the MSE?
Summarization of results via Tableau (Alisha)
