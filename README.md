# Utilizing Data Science to Investigate Protein and Peptide Activity in Parkinson’s Disease

## Introduction:
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating brain disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. The economic burden of PD is significant, with costs estimated to approach $80 billion by 2037. Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for PD, and the disease worsens over time. Research has shown that abnormal protein or peptide activity is a critical factor in the development and progression of PD. By utilizing data science, it may be possible to uncover important insights for the development of treatments that could slow the progression or even cure PD.

## Objectives:
Our primary objective is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of PD by investigating protein and peptide activity in individuals with PD and normal age-matched healthy controls. We will use data science techniques to analyze the data and identify any significant differences between the two groups.

Our secondary objective is to predict the progression of PD in patients using the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). This comprehensive assessment tool measures both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with PD and can provide a measure of PD progression. By analyzing the MDS-UPDRS scores, we aim to make predictions about the disease progression in patients with PD.

## Methodology:
We will collect data on protein and peptide levels in individuals with PD and normal age-matched healthy controls using non-invasive techniques. We will also obtain MDS-UPDRS scores for patients with PD. We will then develop models to analyze the data and identify any significant differences between the two groups. We will use machine learning algorithms to make predictions about the progression of PD in patients based on their MDS-UPDRS scores.

## Data Preparation:
To achieve this objective, we downloaded the protein, peptide, and clinical data that we will work with from Kaggle. After downloading the dataset, we created a new SQLite database. We uploaded the data into the database and used the Python library sqlite3 to connect to the database and retrieve the data by executing SQL queries. Once we had the data, we performed necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types. Finally, we saved the cleaned data to a new CSV file using the Python library pandas.

## Expected Outcomes:
We expect to uncover significant insights into the molecular changes that occur as PD advances. We hope to identify biomarkers that could potentially be used for the early detection of PD and the development of new treatments. We also expect to make predictions about the disease progression in patients with PD that could improve patient outcomes and management.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project aims to investigate protein and peptide activity in individuals with PD and normal age-matched healthy controls to gain a more comprehensive understanding of PD. By utilizing data science techniques, we hope to uncover significant insights that could lead to the development of treatments that could slow the progression or even cure PD. We believe that this research could make a significant contribution to our understanding of PD and lead to groundbreaking discoveries that could improve the lives of millions of people worldwide.
